# CharlotteEdgar-MiniDataAnalysis

This repository contains a mini data analysis made up of two milestones that explore a cancer dataset. Each milestone folder contains a RMD and a MD file. In the first milestone we explored the dataset and came up with 4 research questions and in the second we fit models to answer a specific research question.

To engage with the repository, each milestone has it's own folder and within the folder is an MD file and an RMD file. The files can all be opened in RStudio. There is also an output folder which contains a summary table and a model.
